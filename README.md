When the project is done i will put some pictures of the real one on here.

This is all the resources im using to make a real life pipboy from fallout 76 (The Pip Boy 2000 MK IV).
This repo will contain al the 3d models i used as well (DISCLAIMER IM TERRIBLE AT MAKING 3D MODELS THESE ARE NOT MINE IF I FIND THE MODEL AGAIN I WILL UPDATE THE REPO TO GIVE CREDIT).

I have been working on this project for the last few months now and it is really starting to come together that is why I have set up this repo as I have all the stuff I need to makde a simple fleshed out repo.



My plan of what i really need to do now is:



-Finsih off the Pip-Boy app (add more tabs and make some of the items interactive)



-Fix the browser and give it the green lines even when searched so it always looks like its on a pip-boy



-Put it on a rasberry piko (I dont know wheather it will run on there due to memory if not i will just use a normal rasberry pie)



-Paint the 3D model when its done



-connect the rasberry pie (piko or not) to a screen



-add a trackpad to the design somewhere (like the ones on the steam deck)



-implemnet a keyboard (like on the older phones so its small and can be hidden easily)



-Implemet the browser into the app (so its like one of the STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO then like SEARCH or something)








We Want it to be basicaly identical to the original.

I have made a simple pipboy app that i will keep updating.
It has a few tabs like the real one (STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO).
All of the stats can be changed in  the player_data.json file.

I am slowly working on a duckduckgo based browser for the Pip-Boy but keep running into errors I will update the Repo as soon as i fix it.
For some reason when I search something only like the top 15% actually has duckduckgo and the rest is just the green lines.
I am Going to upload the files for the browser when i get it at least half working.

To make this project me and some friends all worked togother as I found 3d models and edited them a little my friends scetched out designs. When the 3D models were done we started 3D printing them they arent done yet but they should be 
soon. I coded up all the apps although im quit bad at python and the code looks AI coz i had to use AI to clean up all my code because it was past unreadable.
