When the project is done i will put some pictures on here.

This is all the resources im using to make a real life pipboy from fallout 76 (The Pip Boy 2000 MK IV).
This repo will contain al the 3d models i used as well (DISCLAIMER IM TERRIBLE AT MAKING 3D MODELS THESE ARE NOT MINE IF I FIND THE MODEL AGAIN I WILL UPDATE THE REPO TO GIVE CREDIT).

I have made a simple pipboy app that i will keep updating.
It has a few tabs like the real one (STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO).
All of the stats can be changed in  the player_data.json file.

PIP BOY BROWSER (STILL VERY VERY BETA WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY YET)
