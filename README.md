When the project is done i will put some pictures of the real one on here.

This is all the resources im using to make a real life pipboy from fallout 4 (The Pip Boy 3000 MK VI).

I have been working on this project for the last few months now and it is really starting to come together that is why I have set up this repo as I have all the stuff I need to makde a simple fleshed out repo.


My plan of what i really need to do now is:



-Finish off the Pip-Boy app (add more tabs and make some of the items interactive)



-Fix the browser and give it the green lines even when searched so it always looks like its on a pip-boy



-Put it on a rasberry pi 0 (or smth other will updatw when doing the electronics



-Paint the 3D model when its done (done in like 7 hours pics soon)



-connect the rasberry pie to a screen (LCD idk size rn)

We Want it to be basicaly identical to the original.
Its going to be difficult but we can rely heavily on a good paint job to make it look alot better

I have made a simple pipboy app that i will keep updating. (Giant update soon)

It has a few tabs like the real one (STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO).

All of the stats can be changed in  the player_data.json file.

The code is quite horrible it just contains alot of if statments lol im not really a python developer im more of a game dev but I said that I would do it for the group. On the map page if you press on the actual map with the mouse you can drag it 
around. 

Also when you are on the INV tab you can use arrow up and down to scroll through items.

I am slowly working on a duckduckgo based browser for the Pip-Boy but keep running into errors I will update the Repo as soon as i fix it.
For some reason when I search something only like the top 15% actually has duckduckgo and the rest is just the green lines.
I am Going to upload the files for the browser when i get it at least half working.

To make this project me and some friends all worked togother as I found 3d models and edited them a little my friends scetched out designs.I coded up all the apps although im quit bad at python and the code looks AI coz i had to use AI to clean up all my code because it was past unreadable.

The person who made the 3d models website is here http://ytec3d.com/pip-boy-3000-mark-iv/  and here  https://www.youtube.com/@ytec3d/videos
go support them as they put aload of time and effort into these.

The files will also be here in the repo (They used the https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ license alowing me to put them here as well) and ill put the Thingverse link here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2301843

I unfortunately dont have the files i edited to suit my liking due to them being done on the orca slicer and i just sent them to print rather than saving.

Here are the images before and during print
