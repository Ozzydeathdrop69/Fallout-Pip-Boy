# Fallout-Pip-Boy

This is all the resoreces im using to make a real life pipboy from fallout 76 (The Pip Boy 2000 MK IV)


I have made a simple pipboy app that i will keep updating.
It has a few tabs like the real one (STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO)
All of the stats can be changed in  the player_data.json file
