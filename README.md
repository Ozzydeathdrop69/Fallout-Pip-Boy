When the project is done i will put some pictures of the real one on here.

This is all the resources im using to make a real life pipboy from fallout 76 (The Pip Boy 2000 MK IV).
This repo will contain al the 3d models i used as well (DISCLAIMER IM TERRIBLE AT MAKING 3D MODELS THESE ARE NOT MINE IF I FIND THE MODEL AGAIN I WILL UPDATE THE REPO TO GIVE CREDIT).


 To make this project me and some friends all worked togother as I found 3d models and edited them a little my friends scetched out designs. When the 3D models were done we started 3D printing them they arent done yet but they should be 
 soon. I coded up all the apps although im quit bad at python and the code looks AI coz i had to use AI to clean up all my code because it was past unreadable.

Bad Scetch I made a little while ago. :)

I have made a simple pipboy app that i will keep updating.
It has a few tabs like the real one (STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO).
All of the stats can be changed in  the player_data.json file.

I am slowly working on a duckduckgo based browser for the Pip-Boy but keep running into errors I will update the Repo as soon as i fix it.
For some reason when I search something only like the top 15% actually has duckduckgo and the rest is just the green lines.
I am Going to upload the files for the browser when i get it at least half working.
